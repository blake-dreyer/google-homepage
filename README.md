<h1>This is my first project in The Odin Projects foundation series after learning the basics of HTML and CSS through FreeCodeCamp.Com</h1>
The primary goal for me during this simple project recreating the google homepage was to practice basic layout and styling as well as getting used to the git workflow. 
<h2> Things I learned:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Placing and moving basic items on the page like div's and forms utilizing CSS Flexbox</li>
    <li>Workflow and file managment, this is the first time I created a directory with a seperate style sheet and images in addition to utilizing git throughout the project</li>
    <li>How to create a horizontal navbar and both split it and fix it to the top of the page</li>
    <li>Basic responsiveness, I ensured the site performed on both mobile and desktop screens by using the browser development tools</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thanks for checking out my first project!</h2>
